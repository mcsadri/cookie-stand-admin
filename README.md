## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- [X] The `spec` for lab is screen shot of [Cookie Stand Admin Version 1](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-37/lab/cookie-stand-admin-version-1.png)
- [X] `pages/Index.js` should…
  - [X] Have `<Head>` component with page title set to `Cookie Stand Admin`
  - [X] Have a `<header>` component that matches spec.
  - [ ] Have a `<main>` component containing `<form>` and a placeholder component showing JSON string of last created Cookie Stand.
  - [X] Have a `<footer>` component that matches spec.
- [X] Style app using TailwindCSS utility classes.

## Implementation Notes

- [X] Follow Install [Tailwind CSS with Next.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) steps.
  - [X] NOTE: There are a couple small differences between Tailwind’s directions and the way we’ll be running things:
    - [X] name your app `cookie-stand-admin` instead of `my-project`
    - [X] use `--javascript` flag instead of `--typescript`
    - [X] E.g. `npx create-next-app@latest cookie-stand-admin --javascript --eslint`
    - [X] choose `no` or the default for remaining options.
- [X] Strip out unused files
  - [X] Won’t break if they get left in, but a good practice to remove stuff you’re not using.
